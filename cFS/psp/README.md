# Core Flight System : Framework : Platform Support Package

This repository contains NASA's Platform Support Package (PSP), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This is a collection of APIs abstracting platform specific functionality to be located in the `psp` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS>, which includes build and execution instructions.

## Version History

### Development Build: 1.4.0+dev76

- Provide a new framework and perform PSP coverage tests. New coverage test executable is built and several files within PSP are targeted.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/184>
 
### Development Build: 1.4.0+dev71

- Restructure code to make more amicable for rebuilding in a unit test environment. No major changes, primarily just shifting code between locations/headers to support unit testing.
-  Adds a char element `Version` to `CFE_PSP_VersionInfo_t` containing the version number expressed as a string. Defines new macros for the Build Number and the Build Baseline.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/176>

### Development Build: 1.4.14

- Changes the PSP reference to be compatible with the change in nasa/osal#449 making the BSP modules more generic and changes the name.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/175>

### Development Build: 1.4.13

- Changes the PSP reference to be compatible with the change in nasa/osal#449 making the BSP modules more generic and changes the name.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/167>

### Development Build: 1.4.12

- Replace 'OS_VolumeTable' with OS_FileSysAddFixedMap() in all PSPs.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/166> 

### Development Build: 1.4.11

- Removes non-termination string warnings when building with GCC9.
- Exception handling is now implemented on POSIX. There is no longer a separate handler for SIGINT - it is now treated as an exception and goes through the normal process which ends up "restarting" CFE. On pc-linux causes the process to exit normally. There is now a mechanism to capture the CTRL+C exception code and use it during normal test cycles.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/160>

### Development Build: 1.4.10

- Implements full-precision microsecond conversion
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/155>

### Development Build: 1.4.9

- RTEMS builds successfully without errors
- Build script uses a proper CMakeLists.txt instead of the aux_source directory
- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/153>)

### Development Build: 1.4.8

- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/151>)

### Development Build: 1.4.7

- Fixed some build warnings for MCP750
- Minor updates (see <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/142>)

### Development Build: 1.4.6
